     * simular functions as that provided by jQuery deferred objects.
     *
     * The returned Promise is a proxy for a value not necessarily known when the promise is created. It allows you to associate handlers
     * with an asynchronous action's eventual success value or failure reason. This lets asynchronous methods return values like synchronous
     * methods: instead of immediately returning the final value, the asynchronous method returns a promise to supply the value at some point
     * in the future.
     *
     * A Promise is in one of these states:
     * <ul>
     * <li> pending: initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected.
     * <li> fulfilled: meaning that the operation was completed successfully.
     * <li> rejected: meaning that the operation failed.
     * </ul>
     *
     * A pending promise can either be fulfilled with a value or rejected with a reason (error). When either of these options happens, the
     * associated handlers queued up by a promise's then method are called synchronously. If the promise has already been fulfilled or rejected
     * when a corresponding handler is attached, the handler will be called synchronously, so there is no race condition between an asynchronous
     * operation completing and its handlers being attached.
     *
     * As the `then()` and `catch()` methods return promises, they can be chained.
