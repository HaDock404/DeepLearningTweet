## Sentiment analysis using Deep Learning

A companyâ€™s brand image has become intrinsically linked to its social media presence and reputation. Online platforms provide an unprecedented forum for the dissemination of opinions, whether positive or negative.
The need for businesses to actively monitor their digital presence and anticipate bad buzz has become imperative.  

Our goal is to provide [censored]() with a powerful and predictive tool, capable of analyzing trends, detecting weak signals and enabling proactive intervention to prevent any negative impact on its online reputation.  

The main objective of our project is to develop an intelligent system capable of analyzing and understanding the sentiment of a message posted by a user on a social network, in this case here [Twitter](https://twitter.com/home?lang=fr). Using advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques, our solution will seek to extract key information, establish semantic connections and create a representation of user sentiment.
